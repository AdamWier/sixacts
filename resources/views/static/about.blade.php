                    The Six Acts online poll will <i>go live to the public at 4pm on the 17th August 2019.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To mark the occasion and to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre, the
                    Peterloo Memorial Campaign and the Six Acts team will be throwing a public 'Illegal PICNIC'
                    launch party on the site of the massacre – <strong>Manchester Central forecourt, Windmill Street,
                    M2 3GX on the 17th August, from 3 – 5:30pm.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The event will kick off with regional marchers and parades arriving at 3pm, followed by a shared
                    picnic with live entertainment and a 'democratic marketplace' of discussions, sharing of ideas and
                    debate. This will act as a first 'health check' of our democratic practices and devising practical
                    reforms to recondition and redesign a democracy that works for us all in the 21st century.                </p>
                <p>
                    For more information about the 17th August Illegal Picnic event, including opportunities for stall
                    holders, see our <a href="http://peterloomassacre.org/news.html" target="_blank">events</a> page.

                <p>
                    We will open the Six Acts online poll website at 4pm, 17th August.
                    This is when you will be able to log in, submit proposals and begin voting on them.
                    <i>Remember: Each Six Acts proposal will be strictly limited to 100 words maximum.</i>
                </p>
                <h2 class="is-3">The Launch</h2>
                <p>
                    We are not <i>limiting the number of proposals</i> any individual or organisation can submit to the
                    poll, or the number of proposals an individual or organisation can vote for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A user can <i>only vote for each proposal</i> once and this vote <i>can be removed</i> by the user
                    at any time  during the live poll period, should they change their minds. You can also delete
                    your proposal at any time if you feel it has been superseded by another, improved one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we leave it to the user to decide the number of proposals they vote for, we urge people to
                    treat their votes sparingly, with respect, and only vote for proposals that you believe are genuine,
                    effective and feasible reforms for optimising our democratic practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A user can submit a new proposal to the poll at any time during the live period. There are some
                    practical restrictions and guidelines for submissions which we have implemented to prevent
                    misuse and maximise constructive input. Please read our
                    <a href="{{Site::menuLink('nine_rules')}}">9 Rules for the 6 Acts</a> and
                    <a href="{{Site::menuLink('categories')}}">Categories Explained</a> documents before
                    submitting a proposal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We urge participants to road-test their proposals on friends, colleagues and the Six Acts
                    community social media platforms before submitting to the poll. This will give you a chance to
                    refine, tweak or reconsider your proposal, giving it a better chance of being a contender for the
                    final Six Acts document. It is also important that you are completely happy with your proposal at
                    the time you submit it because <i>once submitted you will not be able to edit it.</i>
                    (Only delete and replace it.)
                </p>
                <h2 class="is-3">The Result</h2>
                <p>
                    The online poll will be live from the <b>17th August.</b>
                    During the live period we will be taking <b>regular snapshots</b> of the current version of the
                    document. <b>The first of these will be published shortly before the Conservative government's
                    annual party conference, which will be held in September at the site of the Peterloo Massacre.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        An appropriate final closing date for the finished Six Acts document will be collectively chosen later.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also get a <i>Status Report</i> of the top-ranking proposals at any time. This report
                    will be a summary of the top proposals which are leading in each of the six reform categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Six Acts team will also announce and display status reports at regular intervals, which will
                    include not only the leading proposal in each category, but will also have links to the other 5
                    closest contenders.
                </p>
                <h2 class="is-3">The Result</h2>
                <p>
                    The end document will be a single-page mandate from the people which articulates their demands
                    for democratic reform. We invite the media, campaign groups, organisations, individuals and
                    politicians to cite, publicise and adopt these Six Acts as a basis for policy-making or further
                    research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Six Acts document will also serve as a position statement or manifesto that groups and
                    individuals can sign up to and endorse, as well as being adapted into a petition to be presented to
                    the Petitions Committee for debate in Parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the proposals submitted to the poll will be preserved on the site in an archive for future
                    debate and reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        Rather than a fixed, rigid manifesto, we want the Six Acts to be a working document which can
                        be updated or reviewed annually and revisited on an ongoing basis... particularly on the 16th
                        of August each year
